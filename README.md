# DU_CDC_Portfolio

## Description

DU Coding bootcamp portfolio.

This project is my very first attempt at creating a portfolio using what I have learned in my brief time in school. As my classes progress I will be revisiting this repo and adding those projects to this page to show future employers my progress and knowledge oh HTML, CSS, Advanced CSS, JavaScript, and other coding programs.
